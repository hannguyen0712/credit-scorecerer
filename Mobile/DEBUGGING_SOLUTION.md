# üõ† AI Credit Optimizer - Debugging Solution

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Missing Native Projects**
- **Problem**: iOS and Android native projects were missing
- **Solution**: Created native projects using React Native CLI and copied them to the main project

### 2. **Missing Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Several packages were missing or outdated
- **Solution**: Installed all required dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install @tanstack/react-query react-native-toast-message react-native-circular-progress react-hook-form axios react-native-permissions @types/react-native-push-notification
  ```

### 3. **TypeScript Errors**
- **Problem**: Multiple TypeScript compilation errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated React Query imports to use `@tanstack/react-query`
  - Added proper type annotations
  - Fixed query syntax to use new TanStack Query format
