# Credit-scorecerer
CreditScorecerer is a personal finance tool that help users improve their credit health. The app uses predictive modeling, personalized guidance, and spending analysis to optimize users’ credit card activity in real time by recommending payment strategies, usage timing, reward-maximizing purchases so users stay on top of their credit.

With more than 50 million young credit card users in the U.S. and growing interest in AI-powered tools, Credit Scorecerer meets a clear and underserved need. Our mission is to simplify credit education, reduce financial stress, and promote upward mobility through smarter, tech-enabled decision-making.

We provide active, not just passive, credit guidance by helping users make informed financial decisions and take immediate steps toward credit health and personal finance improvement.


# Features
1. All-in-one personalized credit management and guidance support beyond just account and credit score information.
The algorithm utilizes Google Gemini API to evaluate multiple credit cards, balances, payment due dates, and reward structures to make smart financial suggestions such as:
	•	“Pay $120 on Card A this week to keep utilization under 20%”
	•	“Use Card B for groceries this month to maximize 3% cashback rewards”

2. Real-time account balance and credit information -> informed decisions with card usage
The platform analyzes real-time account activity (payment history, credit utilization, age of credit, etc.) to forecast credit score changes using predictive analysis. It informs users how specific actions like paying off a balance early or keeping utilization under 30% can impact their score.

3. Personalized Chat-based Financial Coach with Google Gemini API
An AI assistant built on Gemini API to answer user questions about credit, debt management, and budgeting. This bridges the financial knowledge gap for young users with limited exposure to financial education.
